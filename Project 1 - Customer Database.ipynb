    "- **Your solution should be in Python**\n",
    "- **For each question you may use as many cells for your solution as you like**\n",
    "- **You should document your solution and explain the choices you've made (for example by using multiple cells and use Markdown to assist the reader of the notebook)**\n",
    "- **You should not remove the problem statements, and you should not modify the structure of the notebook**\n",
    "- **Your notebook should be runnable, i.e., clicking [>>] in Jupyter should generate the result that you want to be assessed**\n",
    "- **You are not expected to use machine learning to solve any of the exercises**\n",

To your horror you've been told that such a database doens't exist, and the only record of sales transactions is kept by John from finance in an Excel spreadsheet. So you've emailed John asking for a CSV dump of the spreadsheet...\n",
